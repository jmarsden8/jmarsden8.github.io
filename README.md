# Peronal portfolio website

This project is a personal portfolio website highlighting my experience, projects and qualifications.

The website was developed using React JS and tailwind CSS.

There is a home page, an about me section which gives a high level overview of my expierence and immediate career aspirations.
Also, there is a projects & qualifications page showing some courses and qualifications I have completed as well as some projects I have developed using what I learnt.
