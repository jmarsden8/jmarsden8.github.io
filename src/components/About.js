          Welcome to my personal portfolio website! <br />
          <br /> My journey began with a degree in Forensic Psychology, which
          equipped me with a unique perspective on human behavior and analytical
          thinking. This foundation has been invaluable in my current role as a
          Manager at an Executive Search Firm, where I hone my skills in
          leadership, strategy, and talent acquisition. <br />
          <br /> Over the past year, I've discovered a profound passion for
          software engineering. This new direction has been fueled by a desire
          to solve problems, create innovative solutions, and embrace continuous
          learning. My technical journey has led me to gain hands-on experience
          and earn certificates in several key technologies, including Python 3,
          JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Flask, and React JS. <br />
          <br />
          During this time, I've dedicated myself to mastering these
          technologies, building projects, and understanding the nuances of
          coding. My goal is to transition into a full-time role as a Software
          Engineer, where I can apply my skills, creativity, and problem-solving
          abilities to real-world challenges. <br />
          <br /> I thrive on creating things from scratch and am driven by a
          constant need to challenge myself and grow. Whether it's designing a
          sleek web application, optimizing code, or exploring the latest tech
          trends, I am always eager to learn and improve. <br />
          <br /> Thank you for visiting my portfolio. I look forward to
          connecting and exploring opportunities in the exciting world of
          software engineering!
